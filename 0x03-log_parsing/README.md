# 0x03. Log Parsing Project

## Overview

For the “0x03. Log Parsing” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of Python programming, focusing on parsing and processing data streams in real-time. This project involves reading from standard input (stdin), handling data in a specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data. 

## Concepts Needed

### File I/O in Python
- Understand how to read from `sys.stdin` line by line.
- [Python Input and Output](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html)

### Signal Handling in Python
- Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.
- [Python Signal Handling](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html)

### Data Processing
- Parsing strings to extract specific data points.
- Aggregating data to compute summaries.

### Regular Expressions
- Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.
- [Python Regular Expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)

### Dictionaries in Python
- Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
- [Python Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)

### Exception Handling
- Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
- [Python Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)

By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be well-prepared to tackle the log parsing project, effectively handling data streams, parsing log entries, and computing metrics based on the processed data.

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

2. Ensure your files are executable:
    ```sh
    chmod +x <file_name>
    ```

3. Run the script:
    ```sh
    ./<file_name>
    ```

## Usage

- Follow the coding standards as specified.
- Ensure all functions and scripts adhere to PEP 8 guidelines.
- Handle exceptions and edge cases effectively.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, you will have a good understanding of how to parse and process data streams in real-time using Python, handle signals, and compute metrics from log entries.
