# Minimum Operations Problem

## Project Overview
In this project, you will devise a solution to efficiently calculate the minimum number of operations to achieve a given number of characters using only “Copy All” and “Paste” operations. This requires understanding several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts.

## Concepts Needed
### Dynamic Programming
Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.
- [Dynamic Programming (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/)

### Prime Factorization
Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number n.
