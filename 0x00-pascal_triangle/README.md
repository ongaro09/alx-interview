## Introduction

Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical concept that forms a triangle of numbers. Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. This project provides a simple Python script to generate and display Pascal's Triangle for a given number of rows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

Clone the repository or download the `pascals_triangle.py` script directly to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pascals-triangle-python.git
cd pascals-triangle-python
